<p>Business Science Lab 89: Causal Inference in R Part 1: A/B Testing (Beginner) Hotel Bookings and Adspend Analysis</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Does Adspend increase bookings?</p></li>
<li><p>By how much? Was there a Return on Adspend (ROAS)?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Can we create an experiment?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yes. We can work with Marketing to design Google Ads for keyword searches (e.g.&nbsp;travel to Chicago)</p></li>
<li><p>We can set Treatment and Control by Geography, which allows us to match bookings through the experiment</p></li>
<li><p>This is called GeoExperimentation: Where the treatment is administered at the geo-level</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We can see that the <strong>Estimated ROAS is 2.67</strong>. This means that for every dollar spent on the marketing campaign, we get $2.67 back in bookings.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>We have answered the two questions that we set out to answer:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Does Adspend increase bookings?</strong> Yes, there is a statistically significant effect. At a 0.10 level, we can say that there is a statistically significant effect. <strong>The Average Treatment Effect is $96.20</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>By how much? Was there a Return on Adspend (ROAS)?</strong> Yes, there was a return on adspend. <strong>The Estimated ROAS is 2.67</strong>. This means that for every dollar spent on the marketing campaign, we get $2.67 back in bookings.</p></li>
